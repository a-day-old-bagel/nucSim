Custom Commands:
...
./DiffEXsect 100 1000000 1000 > DiffEXsect.dat

DiffEXsect->Draw("Electron >> h222(100,0,1000000)","dSigma_dE")

Only detect the first compton even in geant4 by setting a flag in SteppingVerbose on the first interaction and turning it off for following events until next particle starts.
